  "instructions": [
    "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "In a medium mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, maple syrup, egg, and vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth and well incorporated.",
    "In a separate small bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, baking soda, and sea salt.",
    "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until just combined and a dough forms. If using, fold in the dark chocolate chips.",
    "Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, portion the dough into 12 balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.",
    "Use a fork to gently press down on each dough ball in a crisscross pattern to flatten slightly.",
    "Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are just set. The cookies will be soft; they will firm up as they cool.",
    "Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely."

  "tips": [
    "For a gluten-free version, substitute whole wheat flour with an equal amount of oat or almond flour.",
    "Do not overbake — cookies continue to set while cooling; they’re best slightly soft in the center.",
    "Ensure peanut butter is well-stirred and at room temperature for easiest mixing.",
    "For extra protein, add 1–2 tablespoons of unflavored protein powder; you may need a splash of milk if dough becomes too dry."
